If everyone on the team suddenly disappeared and were replaced with someone with no experience, would they be able to pick up where you left off?  
would they have to learn everything from scratch?

Documenting what you do and what you learn is **VERY** important for the success of the team.  
Future members of the team should not have to go through all of the experiences that you went through to get to your knowledge level.
