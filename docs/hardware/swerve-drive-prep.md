# Getting the robot set up
Remove the bumper and make sure that the swerve modules are free, they should be able to rotate freely  
Your life will be easier if the robot is higher up (use the pump cart)

# set up the phoenix tuner
open phoenix tuner X and the drivers station at the same time
open the menu using the left hand side in the menu where it says to enter a team number or IP enter the text "Driver Station"

the software might prompt you to run a temporary diagnostics server if it does then deploy it  

the exact hardware might vary from year to year but you should see 4 encoders

# prep the robot
this link shows what the robot coordinate system is and is important for tuning the encoders to give a correct output  
https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/basic-programming/coordinate-system.html  


# zero the encoders 
swerve modules are asymmetric, each wheel has a bevel gear on one side, when zeroing the encoders the bevel gears should all be facing the same direction
