# From Zero to Swerve
This is a basic introduction to initializing a RobotPy (WPILib Python) project to the spec of the team. I won't go in-depth on standards or code, but this will get a deployable 'Hello World!' to run on a RoboRIO. Other docs for actual swerve, hardware, etc are elsewhere.

Prior to reading this, you should familiarize yourself with [Pipenv](/docs/programming/pipenv.md) and read up on some of the official docs, as well as our philosophies for programming and standards*.

*Some of these pages are incomplete and not yet written.

## Initialize your Codebase
Likely, you will be starting from something already, but this is assuming you aren't. For example, the [swerve-template](https://github.com/smnwteam1982/swerve-template) project which contains the basis of a swerve drive style drivetrain in Python. If you are not starting from a template, you will likely need to initialize the repository with `pipenv`. I will not document this here unless it becomes necessary, but the basic idea of creating a Git Repository from scratch and installing dependencies with `pipenv` is straightforward.
